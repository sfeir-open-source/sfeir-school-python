# Slides

You can view the slides [here](https://sfeir-open-source.github.io/sfeir-school-python/).

## Develop

To run docs locally, go in directory `docs` and run `npx serve` of if you don't have node, you can use docker `docker-compose up`, and open slides on http://localhost:3000/.

# Steps

Each exercise has two directories:

- a clean directory to get you started (ex: step-03)
- a solution directory (ex: step-03-solution)

To run an exercise or a solution:

- `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if third-party libraries are required)
- `python main.py`
